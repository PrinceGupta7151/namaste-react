# React Hooks

- useState() - Superpowerful State Variables in react
- useEffect()


# What is re-render in React?
- When talking about React performance, there are two major stages that we need to care about:
-> initial render - happens when a component first appears on the screen
-> re-render - second and any consecutive render of a component that is already on the screen

- Re-render happens when React needs to update the app with some new data. Usually, this happens as a result of a user interacting with the app or some external data coming through via an asynchronous request or some subscription model.


#  Conditional Rendering  
- Rendering on the basis of condition


=> Whenever state variable update, react triggers a reconciliation cycle ( re-renders the component)
